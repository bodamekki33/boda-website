        <p><strong>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</strong>[pron 1] (<i>2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948</i>) was an Indian
            lawyer,[4] anti-colonial
            nationalist[5] and political ethicist[6] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign
            for India's
            independence from British rule.[7] He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The
            honorific
            Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used
            throughout
            the world</p>
